# `code-starter` Branch - OMH Storage Client Library
This branch contains the basic starting codebase for the OMH Storage Client Library. If you are new to the library we recommend using the [`Getting Started Guide`](https://github.com/openmobilehub/omh-storage#getting-started) in the main branch's `README.md` file to learn how to incorporate the client library into your project.
